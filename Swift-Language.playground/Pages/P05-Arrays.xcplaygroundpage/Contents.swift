# Arrays
Time to dive into arrays! An array is an ordered list of items.
## Initialization
How to make an array? Let's look at some examples!
*/
let groceryList: [String] = ["eggs", "onions"]
/*:
 This is how you declare and initalize an array. The syntax to declare an array type is defined by surrounding the type of item in the array with square braces. See above, where the type of groceryList is defined as `[String]`. For that reason, `groceryList` is an array of `String`. There are languages where you can have an array of objects with different types, but in Swift, you have to specify the type of the objects that will be stored in the array, and all objects in the array have to be of that type.
 
The declaration above makes use of an _array literal_ to declare the array. The array literal is the part on the right hand side of the expression: `["eggs", "onions"]`. It's just a shorthand way to both instantiate an array, and place items in it at the same time.
 */
/*:
 As you learned before in the section on type inference, Swift is smart enough to realize that your variable is an array and it's of type `[String]`.
 */
let groceryListWithInferredType = ["eggs", "onions"]
/*:
Remember that you can option click `groceryListWithInferredType` to see what type was chosen.
 
To initialize an empty array using initializer syntax:
 */
let emptyArray = [String]()
/*:
This works too:
*/
let anotherEmptyArray: [String] = []
/*: */
/*:
 ## Inspect the Array
 In many cases, it is important to find out the number of items in your array. You can find the number of items easily by looking at the array's `count` property.
 */
let numberOfItems = groceryList.count
print("the grocery list contains \(numberOfItems) items.")
/*: 
 Notice that, just like Java's `.length` property, this is a property, not a method.
 Sometimes you just want to know whether the array is empty or not:
 */
if groceryList.isEmpty {
    print("The grocery list is empty!")
} else {
    print("The grocery list is not empty!")
}
/*: */

## Adding Stuff to Arrays
Notice that the above arrays are all defined with the `let` keyword, which makes these arrays immutable (unchangeable). You cannot change these arrays at all in any way, so they stay as they are throughout the program.
 
 Uncomment the line below to see what happens when you try to add an item to the immutable array.
 */
//groceryList.append("bread")
/*:
 It says, "Cannot use mutating member on immutable value: 'groceryList' is a 'let' constant."
 
 Let's now define a mutable array to see what features are available when working with mutable arrays:
 */
var mutableGroceryList = ["eggs", "onions"]
/*:
 To add an item to the end of the array, you can use the append method:
 */
mutableGroceryList.append("yogurt")
/*:
 If you want to add an item to somewhere in the middle of the array, you can specify the index at which you want to insert an item and all the items that follow the newly added item will shift to the right.
 
 Notice how after adding "chips", "yogurt" is shifted to the next index.
 */
mutableGroceryList.insert("chips", at: 2)
/*:
 To combine 2 mutable arrays together:
 */
mutableGroceryList += ["cheese", "ice cream"]
/*:
 To retrieve values from the array, subscript syntax is used. You place the index of the item you are trying to retrieve inside square brackets `[]`. Keep in mind that arrays are zero-indexed (i.e. first item's index is 0, second item's index is 1, etc.)
 */
var firstItem = mutableGroceryList[0]
/*:
 - experiment: Use the space below try to retrieve last item in the array. Assign it to a variable called `lastItem`.
 */
// retrieve the last item here!
mutableGroceryList.count
var lastItem = mutableGroceryList[5]

/*:
 Of course, you have the ability to remove an item. This will return the removed item.
 */
let removedItem = mutableGroceryList.remove(at: 0)
mutableGroceryList.count

 ## Challenge
 
 Arrays are great, you will find that you will use them everywhere when you write programs of your own. An array is a list of things. Think about your life and how often you create lists. You do this often for even the smallest tasks. Keep track of how often you create lists through out the day.
 
 In software you will create lists in many situations. You will find you are often creating lists of objects, strings, numbers. Any time you need to keep track of more than one of the same type of thing you'll want to use an array.
 
 Use the concepts covered in this section to test your knowledge and expand your skills.
 
 - callout(Challenge): Imagine you are working on a farm and need to create an app to help with day to day chores.
 
     1. Life on the farm is hard! Every day you need to:
     
         * `"Wake Up"`
         * `"Wash the dishes"`
         * `"Milk the cows"`
     
     Create an array that contains Strings. Define the initial value of the of the array so that it contains the following items above.
     
     2. Well, Ma's given you more chores. Append `"Churn butter"` to the end of your list.
     
     3. Turns out you also need to `"Call the Cows"`. This needs to happen at the end of the day. Add it to the end of your array.
     
     4. Often you need to choose an item from an array. You just got up, your app needs to print a message with the first task! Print the first task in the array. 
     
     5. You'll need to print the next task time each time you tell your app the current task has been completed. A good way to do this is to create a variable. Create a variable named `currentTask`. Set the value to `0` and make sure the type is `Int`. Remeber the `index` of an element in an array is always an `Int`.
     
     6. Print the item in the array at `currentTask`.
     
     7. Add `1` to `currentTask`
     
     8. Print the item in the array at `currentTask` again.
     
     9. Did you `"Feed the Chickens"`? This always happens after breakfast. Add this after `"Wash the dishes"`.
     
     10. Add `1` to `currentTask`
     
     11. Print the item in the array at `currentTask`.
     
     12. Print the entire array

var schedule: [String] = ["Wake up", "wash the dishes", "milk the cows"]
var newItems: [String] = ["churn the butter", "call the cows"]

schedule += newItems

schedule.count

var firstTask = schedule[0]
firstTask

var currentTask: Int = 0
print(schedule[currentTask])

currentTask += 1
print(schedule[currentTask])

schedule.insert("Feed the Chickens", at: 2)
currentTask += 1
print(schedule[currentTask])

print(schedule)

 ### Answer
 
*/
/*
 
// 1
var array = ["Wake Up", "Wash the dishes", "Milk the cows"]

 // 2
array.append("Churn butter")

 // 3

 // 5
var currentTask = 0

 // 6

 // 7
currentTask += 1

 // 8
print(array[currentTask])

 // 9
array.insert("Feed the Chickens", at: 2)

 // 10

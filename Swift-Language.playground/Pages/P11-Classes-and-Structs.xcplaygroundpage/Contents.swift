 # Stop right there!
 
 If this is your first time going through these Playgrounds then you need to stop for a quick detour! Download the [Object-Oriented Programming review](https://github.com/MakeSchool-Tutorials/Intro-Object-Oriented-Programming-Playground/archive/swift3.zip) and go through all the pages there before continuing.
 
 For those of you shaky on Object-Oriented Programming principles, this is an essential exercise to make sure you are ready for app and game development. You should go through it even if you are sure you understand the concepts -- don't worry, it won't take too long and it's a great chance to practice more Swift!
 
 # Classes and Structures
 Classes (and structures) will be the building blocks of your app. They're one of the fundamental aspects of _object-oriented programming_, which is the paradigm you'll be using and is one of the most common programming paradigms in use today. One of the most defining aspects of classes and structures is that they have data associated with them, called _properties_ and ways to manipulate that data, called _methods_.
 */
/*:
 ## Classes
 
 Classes are generally used for code that you might want to use multiple times. For example, let's say you need a way to keep track of vehicles in your app. You'd create a class named `Vehicle` with the following properties:
 * The number of `wheels` that the vehicle has, with `4` as the default value.
 * The vehicle's `color`, with `"black"` as the default value.
 */
class Vehicle  {
    var wheels = 4
    var color = "black"
}
/*:
 Notice that unlike variable names, class names should start with an uppercase letter.
 
 Defining our `Vehicle` class allows us to specify the capabilities of every vehicle we have in our app. To create a new vehicle, let's create an instance of our `Vehicle` class.
 */
let myCar = Vehicle()
/*: 
- note: `myCar` is an _instance_ of the class `Vehicle`. An instance is a specific, concrete object created from a class. There can only ever be one `Vehicle` class, but there can be many instances of vehicles created from it.
 
You can access the properties of `myCar` as follows;
 */
myCar.wheels
myCar.color
//: Note: You can see the values of the properties on the right side of your screen.
//: Let's try changing `myCar`'s color:
myCar.color = "red"
myCar.color
/*:
 ## Subclasses
 Let's say that in your app, there are multiple kinds of vehicles. For example, we might have cars, motorcycles and boats. To structure your app well, you'd define a subclass of `Vehicle` called `Car`. A subclass inherits all the properties of its parent class, meaning that `Car` will have a `color` and `wheels` from the moment it's born. To make our `Car` class even better, let's add a new property to it called `bodyStyle`.
 
 Before we start coding, we should keep in mind that even though every `Car` must have a `bodyStyle`, there is no logical default value for `bodyStyle`. For example, the  `Car`'s `bodyStyle` could be a sedan, coupe, van etc. To deal with this problem, we are going to add an _initializer_. An initializer allows you to pass in some parameters to set up the initial state of the class as it's being constructed.
 */
class Car: Vehicle {
    // 1
    let bodyStyle : String
    
    //2
    init(bodyStyle: String) {
        // 3
        self.bodyStyle = bodyStyle
    }
}
/*:
 There are a few things worth mentioning about the previous code:
 1. Since each `Car` will always have one body style that will never be changed, `bodyStyle` is created as a constant using `let`.
 2. Using `init`, we create an initializer that takes in a `String` called `bodyStyle`.
 3. There's something weird going on here. We have two different variables with the name `bodyStyle` inside the `init` method's scope. We have the parameter that was passed in at #2, but we also have the property from #1. To make sure the compiler doesn't get confused about which we're referring to, we use they keyword `self`. `self` refers to this current instance of `Car`, so `self.bodyStyle` refers to the `bodyStyle` property of this `Car`. It's very common to use the same variable name from the property being initialized for paramaters in initializers.
 */
let taxi = Car(bodyStyle: "sedan")

taxi.bodyStyle
taxi.color
taxi.wheels
/*:
 Notice how even though we didn't define `color` and `wheels` within `Car`, they were inherited from `Vehicle`.
 
 Since we definitely don't want our `taxi`'s `color` to be black, let's define a new class called `Taxi` that has `color` as yellow by default and "sedan" as the default body style. Additionally, let's add the following to our `Taxi` class:
 * A `fare` property.
 * A method called `getInfo` that describes our `Taxi`
 
 */
class Taxi: Car {
    var fare : Int
    
    init(fare : Int) {
        self.fare = fare
        super.init(bodyStyle: "sedan")
        self.color = "yellow"
    }
    
    func getInfo() -> String {
        return "I have \(wheels) wheels and I charge $\(fare) per mile."
    }
}
/*:
 * Notice how we are calling `super.init()`. `super` refers to the superclass, which in this case is `Car`. Using `super.init()`, we are able to access the initializer that we created for `Car`.
 
 * Since `fare` is not an optional, we have to set it in `init` before we call `super.init`. We will go more in details into optionals as properties in a tutorial made specifically to explain properties.
 */
let coolTaxi = Taxi(fare: 30)
coolTaxi.fare
coolTaxi.color
coolTaxi.bodyStyle
coolTaxi.wheels

coolTaxi.getInfo()
//: Let's try changing `fare` and `wheels`.
coolTaxi.fare = 5
coolTaxi.wheels = 6

coolTaxi.getInfo()
/*:
 Notice that `getInfo()` returns the value of `fare` at the moment the function is called, so it returns the updated `fare`.
 */
let otherTaxi = Taxi(fare: 100)

otherTaxi.getInfo()
/*:
 Even though `otherTaxi` and `coolTaxi` both belong to the class `Taxi`, their properties are stored differently. For example, changing `otherTaxi.color` does not change `coolTaxi.color`.
 */
otherTaxi.color = "red"

otherTaxi.color
coolTaxi.color

coolTaxi.color = "pink"

otherTaxi.color
coolTaxi.color
/*: */
/*:
 ## Structures
 We can use structures to group related data. Tuples can do this too, but unlike tuples, structures can also have methods. For example, let's define a `struct` (short for structure) that can hold the size of a car.
 */
struct Size {
    var length: Int
    var width: Int
    var height: Int
    
    init(length: Int, width: Int, height: Int) {
        self.length = length
        self.width = width
        self.height = height
    }
    
    func computeVolume() -> Int {
        return length * width * height
    }
}

let smallCarSize = Size(length: 40, width: 20, height: 30)
print(smallCarSize.computeVolume())

let bigCarSize = Size(length: 100, width: 30, height: 50)
print(bigCarSize.computeVolume())
/*:
So far, it looks like we could have accomplished the same thing using a `class` instead of a `struct`. And in fact, we could have! Try replacing the keyword `struct` with `class` and see what happens. In Swift, classes and structs are very similar, but there are some important differences. For one, `struct`s have no inheritance - they cannot be a subclass or superclass of another `class` or `struct`. We don't expect `Size` to ever have any subclasses - it stands on its own, so we made it a `struct` instead of a `class`.
 */
/*:
 ## Classes vs. Structs
 There are major differences between classes and structs. We already talked about how `struct`s don't have inheritance. Another very important distinction is the following:
 * Classes are passed as a reference.
 * Structs are passed by value.
 
 Let's see what that means.
 */
// Classes

var greenVehicle = Vehicle()
var anotherVehicle = greenVehicle

anotherVehicle.color

greenVehicle.color = "green"

anotherVehicle.color
/*:
 The reason `anotherVehicle.color` was changed when we changed `greenVehicle.color` is that `anotherVehicle` and `greenVehicle` are actually both pointing at the same object. The reason this is happening is because when we set `anotherVehicle` to `greenVehicle`, Swift is not copying the object itself to `anotherVehicle`. Swift is copying a reference to the object and setting it to `anotherVehicle`; therefore, both variables are pointing to the same object, because they hold the same reference.
 
 To confirm that `greenVehicle` and `anotherVehicle` are the same thing, we can do the following:
 */
greenVehicle === anotherVehicle
/*:
- note: The `===` is the _reference equality operator_. It checks to see if two references are referring to the same thing. It's different than `==`, the normal Swift equality operator, which checks if two value types have the same value.
*/
// Structs

var coolSize = Size(length: 40, width: 30, height: 35)
var someSize = coolSize

someSize.height

coolSize.height = 20

someSize.height
/*:
 Notice how `someSize.height` wasn't changed when we changed `coolSize.height`. When it comes to structs, Swift creates a new copy of the instance and passes it as a new value to the variable instead of just referencing to it. This applies to passing `struct`s as parameters as well.
 */

 ### When to use a struct instead of a class?
 
 When you are working with the actual representation of any UI elements, you will always use a class. Why? Labels (`UILabel`), image views (`UIImageView`), table view cells (`UITableViewCell`), and sprites for games (`SKSpriteNode`) will all be classes since your custom versions will inherit from the one's provided by Apple. Only classes support inheritance!
 
 The properties of these UI elements are often represented by structs! Things like color (`UIColor`), position (`CGPoint`), and size (`CGSize`) are all structs. Anything type from core graphics library (starts with `CG`) will be a struct and you'll use these types often to describe the properties of UI elements.
 
 Beyond that, the choice is somewhat up to you. Since iOS development is pretty Object-Oriented Programming heavy, we will tend to use classes for a lot of "living data". We will use structs in place of tuples for any sets of very basic data that we need to represent often.
 
 Apple's documentation (linked below) defines these guidelines for when you might want to use a struct:
 
 - callout(Apple Documentation on structs):
 
     As a general guideline, consider creating a structure when one or more of these conditions apply:
     
     - The structure’s primary purpose is to encapsulate a few relatively simple data values.
     - It is reasonable to expect that the encapsulated values will be copied rather than referenced when you assign or pass around an instance of that structure.
     - Any properties stored by the structure are themselves value types, which would also be expected to be copied rather than referenced.
     - The structure does not need to inherit properties or behavior from another existing type.
     
     In all other cases, define a class, and create instances of that class to be managed and passed by reference. In practice, this means that most custom data constructs should be classes, not structures.
 
 For more details on what we covered here, please visit [Apple's classes and structures guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/ClassesAndStructures.html).

 ### Challenge 
 
 Use the concepts covered in this section to test your knowledge and expand your skills.
 
 - callout(Challenge):
    1. Conceptual Question - Which of the following objects would be better modeled as a class or as a struct?
 
            a. Houses
            b. Nutrition Information
            c. Companies
            d. Points in 3D space (x, y, z)
 
    Can you come up with an everyday object that would be better modeled by one or the other?

    2. Create two classes that model students and a school. A `Student` should have properties for `name` and  `classYear` (enum representing freshman, sophomore, junior, senior). A `School` should have properties for `name`, `year` (2016), and `students` (an array to hold a list of students).

    3. The school needs some instructors. All instructors should have a `name` and `subject` property. Each instructor should have a method called startClass. This method should print "[subject] class is now in session".

    4. Some instructors are coaches. These instructors add a new property: `sport` property. This can be a string. Coach should have a method called `playSport()`. This method should print `"Lets play [sport]"`. `Coach` class should subclass `Instructor`!

    5. You're making an app that keeps track of the weather. You need to wrap the weather data in a convenient package to pass around to various elements in your display. Create a `struct` that has the following properties: `temperature`, `windSpeed`, `cloudPercentage`, `weatherDescription`. `struct` works well here since this is just data we are passing around!
 
 */
// Write your challenge code here:
enum classYear{
    case freshman, sophmore, junior, senior
}
var listStudents: [String] = []

class students{
    var name = ""
    var year = classYear.freshman
    
}

class school{
    var name = ""
    var year: Int = 2016
    var students = listStudents
}

class instructors{
    var name = ""
    var subject = ""
    func startClass(){
        print("\(subject) class is now in session")
    }
}

class coach: instructors{
    var sport = ""
    func playSport (){
        print("lets play \(sport)")
    }
}

struct weather{
    var temp = 80
    var windspeed = 10
    var temperature = 72
    var windSpeed = 5
    var cloudPercentage = 15
    var weatherDescription = "Partially Cloudy, light wind"
    
    
}






/*: 
 ### Answer
 
 #### 1. Class or struct?
 
     a. Depends... If this was a game and we were representing houses the player could enter, modify, and decorate then a class would be best -- in this situation the house represents a "living" object. If this were a realty app for viewing house listings than a struct would suffice. In a realty app we aren't modeling the house itself. We are just creating a container to store data related to it.
     b. A Struct. Nutrition information for food (calorie count, saturated fats, etc) is "dead data". A banana's nutritional information never changes!
     c. Depends... Like the house example it depends on if you are representing a company or information about the company. If you are representing a company that you will regularly be changing and want to have methods like "hireNewEmployee" then a class would be best. If you are only storing data about a company like it's name, number of employees, and it's current assets then you can use a struct.
     d. A Struct. A point in 3D space is definitely "dead data". The character it represents the position of might be living, but points represent a snapshot of information.
 
All in all, these are design choices!

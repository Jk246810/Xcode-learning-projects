 # Protocols
 
 So far we've learned about classes, and how class inheritance can reduce repeated code by having one class inherit the properties and methods of another. But what if we want multiple classes to have similar functionality without them having to inherit every property and method?
 
 Protocols are a way of doing this: one can think of it as a "contract" that classes can follow. If you're coming from a Java background, protocols in Swift are similar to interfaces in Java. An example: in a social network, `Text`, `Image`s, `Link`s, and other content are all "postable" – that is, they should all have some function that posts the content onto the web. Here, we make a protocol `Postable`:
 */




protocol Postable {
    func post()
    func postText(text: String)
    func search (input: String) -> [String]
}
/*:
 Now, all classes that adopt the protocol Postable must include `post()` as one of their functions:
 */
//class Image: Postable {
//    func post() {
//        // post the image
//        print("Image posted!")
//    }
//}
//
//class Link: Postable {
//    let url = "http://xkcd.com"
//    
//    func post() {
//        // post the url
//        print("URL \(url) posted!")
//    }
//}
///*:
//- note:
// Unlike class inheritance, classes adopting a protocol only share the function _signature_ that is common to the protocol; the actual implementation of the function is left to the class.
// 
// Now you can group `Image`s and `Link`s together, even though they don't share a superclass, because they both conform to `Postable`:
// */
//let array: [Postable] = [Image(), Link()]
//
//array[0].post()
//array[1].post()

 ### Challenge
 
 The cool thing about protocols is that you only declare the signature of methods used in a protcol. Protocols never contain body (code) of any methods they declare. So these challenges will be easier than they look. 
 
 - callout(Challenge):
     1. You're building a shooting game with spaceships, helicopters, and motorcycles. Create a protocol so that all of these items can be repaired and destroyed. Think of a good descriptive name for this protocol. Then add two methods one that says the object can be repaired, and another that says the object can be destroyed.
     
     2. Table view is one of the most common UI elements you will work with. It has a very extensive protocol. Imagine you work at Apple and had to write it! The table view needs to know how many cells it will display. Write a protocol called something like `TableViewDataSource`. Give it a method with a named `numberOfCells`. This method should return an Int.
     
     3. The table views can be divided into sections. We need another method that returns the number of sections in a table view. This method must also return an Int.
     
     4. The Postable protocol above is great but you want to add some new methods. Imagine you are making an Twitter clone. You need a method that takes a String  as a parameter. _Add this to the `Postable` protocol above._
     
     5. Your Twitter app is working well. Now you want to search. Add a method to the protocol that takes a search string as a parameter and returns an array of strings. _Add this to the `Postable` protocol above._

// Write your challenge code here:

protocol destroyRepair{
    func destroy()
    func repair()
}

protocol TableViewDataSource {
    func numberOfCells()-> Int
    func numberOfSections()-> Int
    
}

 ### Answer
 */
/*
// 1
protocol Destroyable {
    func repair()
    func destroy()
}

protocol TableViewDataSource {
    func numberOfCells() -> Int     // 2
    func numberOfSections() -> Int  // 3
}


protocol Postable {                           // should be added above!
    func post()                               // old method
    func postText(text: String)               // 4
    func search(search: String) -> [String]   // 5
}
